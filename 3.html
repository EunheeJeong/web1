  <h2>Powerpoint</h2>
  <p>Microsoft PowerPoint (or simply PowerPoint) is a presentation program,[3] created by Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin[3] at a software company named Forethought, Inc.[3] It was released on April 20, 1987,[4] initially for Macintosh computers only.[3] Microsoft acquired PowerPoint for $14 million three months after it appeared.[5] This was Microsoft's first significant acquisition,[6] and Microsoft set up a new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought had been located.[6] Microsoft PowerPoint is one of many programs run by the company Microsoft and can be identified by its trademark orange, and P initial on the logo. It offers users many ways to display information from simple presentations to complex multimedia presentations.

PowerPoint became a component of the Microsoft Office suite, first offered in 1989 for Macintosh[7] and in 1990 for Windows,[8] which bundled several Microsoft apps. Beginning with PowerPoint 4.0 (1994), PowerPoint was integrated into Microsoft Office development, and adopted shared common components and a converged user interface.[9]</p>
